Algorithm
===================================
The formation control algorithms of multi-mobile robots mainly include pilot following method, artificial potential field method, behavior method and virtual rigid body method.
The form of the pilot-following formation control algorithm is simple, and the mobile robot is easy to form a formation. The pilot-following formation control algorithm can be divided into the method based on distance and angle and the method based on distance and distance.
